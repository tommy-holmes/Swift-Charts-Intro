# Swift Charts Intro
A rudimentary stocks app using Swift Charts. This repo hold the associated project for my [blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/@tommy_holmes_/swift-charts-101-building-a-detail-rich-interactive-chart-b517c9cd653).

**This Candle Stick Chart Chart can now be found in [The Swift Charts Examples Repo](https://github.com/jordibruin/Swift-Charts-Examples)**

> **Important:** as Swift Charts is part of the iOS 16 SDK you will need to have the Xcode 14 beta (or newer) installed to open this project. 

## Setting up the charts with real data
I used the [Yahoo Finance API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yh-finance/) to build the 
Models so if you want to build on it and use your own API key then most of the objects should already be there.
